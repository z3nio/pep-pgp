# PEP(pretty easy privacy)

PEP is a modern client-side application for PGP(Pretty Good Privacy) that runs in your browser. The idea is to make the PGP operations as simple yet effective. The user will never need to install any application on their OS, the secrets never leave your browser and it provides a safe way to do your PGP operations.

This application relies heavily on OpenPGP.js & is focused on to work on any device so there may be performance issues related to your current OS & memory limitations. PGP operations are costly and need a good amount of memory to process some of the tasks smoothly.
